This repository is a collection of early Java programs I made when I was learning the Java Programming Language in 2011-2013. Some projects have been modified from their original state for completion or understandings' sake. Others have been left intact as a reminder of where I've come from.

The Minesweeper project has been completed as of 12/13/2019. There is a distributable `Minesweeper.zip` file in the jar/ folder in the project directory.
