This repository is a collection of early Java programs I made when I was learning the Java Programming Language in 2013-2015. Some projects have been modified from their original state for completion or understandings' sake. Others have been left intact as a reminder of where I've come from.

The Random/Minesweeper project has been completed as of 12/13/2019. There is a distributable `Minesweeper.zip` file in the jar/ folder in the project directory.

The Random/Random/tittown (not in fact referring to a town of tits, but a Trouble in Terrorist Town role assignment program) sub-project has been compiled into a runnable jar in `Random/Random/jars/TroubleinTerroristTown.jar`
